*Agile Software Development Process Methodologies*

Software Development:
    #Planning
    #Requirement Analysis
    #Desiging
    #Implement
    #Testing
    #Deploying

Software Development Process:
- The series of actions resulting in the computer instructions & data to perform a specific task (Coding, debugging, designing
  documenting, drawing, testing, deployment, etc.)

Waterfall Methodology (Older methodologies):
Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintainance

- Less flexivility & adaptability: It lacks the ability to adjust easily to changes compared to Agile Methodologies
- Sequential/nature: Once a phase is completed, revisiting & modifying is challenging.

Modern software development processes:
- Scrum, XP, Kanban

Scrum:
- Emphasizes project manageement, what work is getting done, 
- A scrum team works in Sprint 
- A sprint is a time box of one months or less
- A sprint planning is conducted before every sprint attended by the scrum master, development team, & product owner
- During the meeting, high-priority items are seected from the product backlog to form the *sprint backlog*
- Product Owner manages backlog prioritizing features
- Scrum master facilitates daily meetings & ensures adherence to Scrum practices
- Development team implemts the features, delivers the spring backlog


Scrum Artifacts:
- Sprint Review & Sprint Retrospective are the two rituals that occur in post-sprint

Sprint Review:
- The scrum team showcase what it accomplished during the sprint

Sprint Retrospective:
- The team reflects on what went well, what went bad, and what could be improved
