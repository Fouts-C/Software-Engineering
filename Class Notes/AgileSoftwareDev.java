*Agile Software Development Process Methodologies*

Software Development:
    #Planning
    #Requirement Analysis
    #Desiging
    #Implement
    #Testing
    #Deploying

Software Development Process:
- The series of actions resulting in the computer instructions & data to perform a specific task (Coding, debugging, designing
  documenting, drawing, testing, deployment, etc.)

Waterfall Methodology (Older methodologies):
Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintainance

- Less flexivility & adaptability: It lacks the ability to adjust easily to changes compared to Agile Methodologies
- Sequential/nature: Once a phase is completed, revisiting & modifying is challenging.

Modern software development processes:
- Scrum, XP, Kanban

    *Scrum*
- Emphasizes project manageement, what work is getting done, 
- A scrum team works in Sprint 
- A sprint is a time box of one months or less
- A sprint planning is conducted before every sprint attended by the scrum master, development team, & product owner
- During the meeting, high-priority items are seected from the product backlog to form the *sprint backlog*
- Product Owner manages backlog prioritizing features
- Scrum master facilitates daily meetings & ensures adherence to Scrum practices
- Development team implemts the features, delivers the spring backlog


Scrum Artifacts:
- Sprint Review & Sprint Retrospective are the two rituals that occur in post-sprint

Sprint Review:
- The scrum team showcase what it accomplished during the sprint

Sprint Retrospective:
- The team reflects on what went well, what went bad, and what could be improved

Scrum Values:
- Courage: Team members have courage to take on challenges
- Respect: Team members have mutual respect
- Openness: Team members know what each other are working on
- Focus: Team members are focused on sprint goal
- Commitment: Every person on the team is committed to delivering the most valuable product

Scrum Principles: 
- Transparency: processs visibility, shared code base repo, daily scrum
- Inspection: Deviation from expectation prevented by frequent inspection. Sprint review & retrospective
- Adaptation: Sprint retrospective


    *XP*
- XP is a lightweight methodology for small/medium sized teams developing software in the face of rapidly changing requirement
- Small: Release soon & get feedback, adapt quickly to possible change, avoid working too long without customer validation
- Refactioning: We may need to change our design. We take the code, break into pieces, addcode, make it simple

XP Values & Principle:
- Most importatn value is communication 
- XP creates right communication flowing & uses the following practices:
  - pair programming: All production code is written with two people looking at one machine (Don't interfere with each others
                      code/playing a different role of programming & strategy) look at the code to ensure it works, requires
                      testing. Make it simple when possible

  - user stories
  - customer involvement

- Simplicity: Take the simpliest thing that works (Simple not stupid)
- Feedback: Take feedback in differet level (Developer write test cases & gets immediate feedback. Developer estimates
            new stories, take feedback based on that proceeds & then take feedback)
- Courage: Throw out the code if it doesn't work properly, add new feature if it works better than before

Incremental Planning: 
  Select user stories for release -> break stories into tasks -> plan release -> develop; integrate test -> release software ->
  evaluate system & iteration -> repeat

Continuation Integration: 

            programming <-> local test -> integrate -> system test -> programming 

On site customer: 
- The customer is an actual member of the team (sits with team & brings requirements)
